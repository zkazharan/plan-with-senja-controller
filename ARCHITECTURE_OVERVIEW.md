# Overview of the Architecture
The "Plan With Senja" project is a backend application built using Node.js and Express. This application is designed to manage events, bookings, and user authentication. The project structure consists of several key components:

1. **Models**: Uses Mongoose to define data schemas for users, events, and bookings. Each model has relevant attributes and validation to ensure data integrity.
2. **Controllers**: Manages business logic for each entity. There are controllers for user authentication, event management, and bookings. These controllers handle HTTP requests and interact with models to perform CRUD operations.
3. **Middleware**: Uses middleware for JWT authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain routes.
4. **Routes**: Organizes API routes to handle client requests. Routes are divided based on functionality, such as routes for events, bookings, and authentication.
5. **Database**: Uses MongoDB as the database to store application data. The connection to the database is managed through a separate module.

# Assumptions Made
- **Security**: It is assumed that all sensitive data, such as passwords, will be securely stored using hashing (bcrypt) and JWT tokens for authentication.
- **Input Validation**: It is assumed that all user inputs will be validated to prevent invalid or malicious data from entering the system.
- **Error Handling**: It is assumed that the system will handle errors properly, providing appropriate feedback to users in case of failures.
- **Resource Availability**: It is assumed that the server and database will be available and accessible to the application without interruptions.

With this architecture, "Plan With Senja" aims to provide a seamless and secure user experience in managing events and bookings.
